# ðŸ“Š End-to-End Data Analytics Project 

This project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow â€” from raw data collection to interactive dashboards â€” using **R, AWS S3, Shiny, Tableau Cloud, and AI copilots**.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview 

1. **Data Collection** 
   - Downloaded a raw dataset from a public website, files were apprentice data for each individual fiscal year. 

2. **Data Preparation (R)** 
   - Cleaned and standardized the dataset. 
   - Combined (unioned) multiple files into a single structured dataset. 

3. **Cloud Storage (AWS S3)** 
   - Used R to upload the processed dataset into an AWS S3 bucket for cloud storage and scalability. 

4. **Interactive Dashboard (R Shiny + GitHub Copilot)** 
   - Leveraged GitHub Copilot in VS Code to build an interactive **R Shiny dashboard**. 
   - Features include filtering, dynamic charts, and user-friendly data exploration. 

5. **AI-Powered Dashboard (Tableau Cloud + Tableau Copilot)** 
   - Used the same processed dataset to create a **Tableau Cloud dashboard**. 
   - With Tableauâ€™s AI Copilot, I generated automated visualizations, insights, and drill-down views.
   - Saved the completed dashboard on Tableau Public to share.
